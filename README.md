## **The Geodesign Touchtable Application**

The Geodesign touchtable application is a Unity project created by Matthew Plaudis, a research intern at Esri Canada from the University of Victoria, with help from: Michael Luubert, a Web Developer from Esri Canada; Xi Sun, a current Master's Candidate and fellow intern at Esri Canada also from the University of Victoria; the rest of Dr. Yvonne Coady's lab - The Mod Squad, located at the University of Victoria.


The project was intended to replicate and attempt to enchance an existing project, known as UD CoSpaces. This was originally an urban planning application that aimed at maintaining the collaborative design processes commonly used by urban planners, while also adding certain tools to improve interactions with a new development. 


Our application implemented an open source touch interface that allowed for multiple touch points to be recognized simoultaneously - this is crucial to the success of the project since it relies on 3-4 users interacting with it at one time.
