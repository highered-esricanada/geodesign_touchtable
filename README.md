The Geodesign touchtable application is a Unity project created by Matthew Plaudis, a research intern at Esri Canada from the University of Victoria, with help from: Michael Luubert, a Developer from Esri Canada; Xi Sun, a current Master's Candidate and fellow intern at Esri Canada also from the University of Victoria; the rest of Dr. Yvonne Coady's lab - The Mod Squad, located at the University of Victoria.


The project was intended to replicate and attempt to enchance an existing project, known as UD CoSpaces. This was originally an urban planning application that aimed at maintaining the collaborative design processes commonly used by urban planners, while also adding certain tools to improve interactions with a new development. 


Our application implemented an open source touch interface that allowed for multiple touch points to be recognized simoultaneously - this is crucial to the success of the project since it relies on 3-4 users interacting with it at one time. 


The application takes advantage of several tools meant to enhance the design process, including:
 - Field of view analysis
 - Area drawing tool (for highlighting areas and aggregating data on select areas of the development)
 - Shadow simulation tool
 - Model information viewing tool (in order to see how many occupants, jobs, floors, floor types, etc.)
 - Building extrusion / construction tool
